The Zoho School of Technology is known for its unique educational practices. Zoho School started in 2005 as a meaningful alternative to a conventional college education. What started with just 6 students in its first year has now groomed over 800 software professionals who are proud employees of Zoho Corporation.</p>
<br>

<h style="font-size:500%;">WHAT WE TEACH...?</h>
<p style="font-size:140%;">
The Zoho School of Technology focuses on what is needed to become a well-rounded software engineer. Our two-year programme is designed to bring out the best of every student who joins us. The first year of learning will involve subjects like Structured Problem Solving, industry-relevant programming languages, Web, Mobile and Client-Server Technologies, Foundational Mathematics for Software Engineering, and Communication Skills. <br>


The students join the teams at Zoho after one year of classroom-training and work as interns the following year.<br>


Contextual learning is the key difference at Zoho Schools. The students are free to discover the beauty of programming through practical learning rather than a boring dump of dry theory. A plethora of guest lectures from practicing professionals from Zoho Corporation ensures that they stay abreast with current IT trends. Experiential learning makes it all the more enjoyable.</p>
<h style="font-size:500%;">WHAT WE EXPECT ...?</h>

The Zoho School of Business was conceived in 2019, as a way to bridge the huge gap between industry expectations and the guidance typically provided in academia, especially in Business Schools. Drawing from the indigenous knowledge Zoho had developed over the years in the SaaS domain, the L&D team at Zoho Schools has curated a curriculum perfectly suited for the modern workplace. It is indeed a matter of pride to us that Zoho is a forerunner in the domain of SaaS, and has successfully spread its wings across the length and the breadth of the globe.</p>

<h style="font-size:500%;">WHAT WE TEACH...?</h>

The students also undergo rigorous training on public-speaking and leadership skills. The motto of ZS is to impart knowledge that is relevant, contemporary, and meaningful. Hence, the curriculum undergoes revision regularly.
